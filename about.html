          <p>
            Mangata and Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in special
            occasions like engagements, weddings and anniversaries. The jewelry
            company primarily operates online and has a small storefront in
            Austin, Texas with an atelier attached for browsing. Mangata &
            Gallo's selection of jewelry is known for its high-quality and
            classic look. The owner, an Austin local, is well known for her
            jewelry designs. Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of
            Mangata and Gallo.

            After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond
            cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown,
            Austin and started to grow her business online. Mariana has always
            managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to
            marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several
            artisans to help craft her designs and a young employee to help
            manage the company website and social media accounts.
